reflection
1: same code as answer
2: same code but different names for function name and parameter
  the example define the num1 and num2 using let before calling the function in console.log, whereas
  I included the whole function in the console log and put the number 5 and 10 in the argument
3: same code but different names for function name and parameter
  same thing as example 2
4. same code but different names for function name and parameter
  same as example 2 and 3, I put the arguments directly into the calling of the function instead
  of defining beforehand

  I understand the differnce from the examples and why that would be better to define the numbers or array
  prior to calling the function. If you are to use those variables over and over, you could just define it
  once and use the variable when calling the function
